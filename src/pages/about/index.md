### Arise

This is the hour that Esthers are rising up to do what they were created and called to do for such a time as this. They are rising up to be true queens, prepared as a pure and spotless bride ready for their bridegroom, Jesus Christ’s return. They are rising up from the wilderness leaning on Him. They are rising to be a voice in this hour. They are birthing their promises and what the Father has spoken over their lives. They are rising up out of shame, defeat, and fear to step into the fullness of their destinies. This is the hour to come out of hiding to rise and shine.

### Overcome

Esthers are empowered to overcome every obstacle!  They pass the tests, persevere, and are set free, healed, and delivered. Esthers birth God’s promises and dreams.   Esthers will cry and intercede together in the courtroom of heaven for the greatest harvest we have ever seen.  They will expose wickedness and be a voice for righteousness.  This includes being a voice for children, the vulnerable, and the unborn.  Esthers will open their mouth and expose deception (the Haman spirit) in the nations. 

### Birthing Gods Promises -Saying Yes

Saying yes means laying down your life for Jesus at all costs. Esthers voluntarily and willingly obey Jesus and love him wholeheartedly.    They will not shrink back even when faced with loss or death.  They will boldly proclaim the gospel and expose the counterfeit even if it costs them their life.

The mission of Esthers Arise is to empower women to birth God's promises in their lives through preparation, partnership, and obedience to our Lord Jesus Christ.

### PAUL & NANCY

Paul and Nancy Knopp met at the International House of Prayer in Kansas City. Paul is from Virginia and Nancy is from Ontario, Canada. They have both been in leadership with local churches, movements, campuses, and praying communities for over 20 years.

Paul and Nancy are called to raise up the body of Christ who will stand as watchmen and watchwomen on the wall of intercession and be voices in the nations for righteousness and truth. The desire of the Lord's heart for the body of Christ to be released and be set free from bondage in this hour is critical to the fullness of what God is doing in the earth and how He is making His bride ready for the return of Jesus.

Paul and Nancy love the word of God, worship, coffee dates, biking, and thier family.  They reside in Raleigh, North Carolina and have two sons.
