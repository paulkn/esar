JOIN THE ESTHERS ARISE MOVEMENT

The Esthers Arise movement has a vision to mobilize and activate women across the nations to arise and take action for such a time as this. 

By joining the Esthers movement you can choose to be a part of a private Esthers Arise study to activate and prepare you as the bride of Christ ready and prepared for this time.  You will  also receive a Esthers Arise ebook to empower you to arise and overcome. 

After signing up, you will be connected to other women and ministries and hear of what God is doing with other women in the nations.

The Esthers Arise movement is currently hosting in person worship and prayer gatherings on a regular basis to activate you to prayer and fasting in your region and America.
