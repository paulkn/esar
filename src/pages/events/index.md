# **Intercession and Worship**

## Charlotte, NC - 08/08/2020

**A day for the watchwomen to come together for intercession & worship for America**

We are in a moment in history to stand in the gap on behalf of America as watchwomen on the wall. The time is now for Esthers to arise, fast, and pray for the turning of America back to righteousness. You are not alone as an Intercessor, God is calling you to rise up and overcome in this hour and say yes to Jesus at all costs.

Calling forth the Intercessors...we can not lose one more of our children on our watch.

We are women that travail and cry out together.

The time is now.
