# **Esthers Arise Intercession and Worship near Raleigh NC - March 13th/2021**

A day for women to come together, worship and pray for revival in America and the nations.  A great move of God is among us!  We have seen many women  touched by His presence and set free!

We are in a moment in history to stand in the gap on behalf of America. Children are being aborted every day! The time is now for Esthers to arise, fast and pray for the turning of America back to God. 

You are not alone!  God is calling you to rise up, overcome, and birth your promises in this hour by saying yes to Jesus at all costs

Calling forth the intercessors!

We as women will cry out together! 

We will also fellowship with lunch mid day! 

The time is now!
