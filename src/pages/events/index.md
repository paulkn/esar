# **Intercession and Worship**

MARTINSVILLE VA- NEW DAY CHURCH  

SAVE THE DATE- JANUARY 9, 2021

**A day for the watchwomen to come together to worship and intercede for the United States of America**

We are in a moment in history when it is critical for us to stand in the gap on behalf of America. The time is now for Esthers to arise, fast, and pray for the turning of America back to righteousness. You are not alone as an intercessor! God is calling you to rise up and overcome in this hour and say yes to Jesus at all costs.

Calling forth the intercessors...we are women who travail and cry out together! The time is now!
