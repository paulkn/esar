# I had a vision /dream of women weeping and wailing before me and one of the women’s name was Sharon.  Now Sharons name means “ fertile one” And I can hear the Lord saying “bride I sees you in your tears,

# 

#  I sees you in your weeping  and you are the most fertile one of them all!  I hear him say I love your cry and I am going to answer you!  



# 

# Keep crying out to me!  Weep with tears!  

# 

# For I am going to cause you to be more fruitful than you can imagine!  

## Song of Solomon 2:1

## “I am a Rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys” 

# 

# You will give birth to your promises!
