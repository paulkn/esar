![DNA of God](/img/gods_dna.gif)
I had a dream in 2009 that I was driving about the city and had to turn around. I saw two children running around near their mom.  I turned around and suddenly I saw the children under this car. One of the children I put on a table thinking the child was not breathing and then as I started praying, I saw the child turn from a child into DNA strands. The picture turned into a vision when the DNA or multiplying quickly at the moment of conception. I had spoken JESUS over the DNA, and then as I speak JESUS loudly, I can see the heart start beating in the middle of the DNA. I thought this child will live.  I couldnâ€™t believe I could see the DNA multiply so rapidly. I then try to touch the DNA, and I hear a voice saying WAIT. And I wake up.

Jesus heartbeat is wrapped up in our very being. The only way to the Father is through Jesus Christ. The heartbeat of Jesus must be at the center of your DNA for you or your dreams to LIVE and be birthed. When we trust the Lords leadership, God can do what He purposed and created you for and has not forgotten what He put inside of you. Jesus revives the dream because it is His life and through Him that we live. We must recognize that from the beginning of time and at the moment of conception, He had a dream for you that we could partner with Him in.

The question is what does He want you to partner with Him in? In unity with Him we can fulfill our calling and His plans and purposes for your life. Your dream already has wrapped in it the very heartbeat and desires of Jesus.  With the spoken word from God and Scriptures, and because Jesus died for you to live for eternity, you get to have life and life to the fullest. "For the enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy, but I have come to give you life and life to the full" John 10:10. Nothing can steal what God has placed inside of you, because God has called you to live life to the full. With the word of God you can be able to watch and see how God will unfold this dream or vision before your very eyes as you WAIT on Him.

You carry the very life of the Holy Spirit within you, and He has what it takes for you to partner with Him to fulfill your calling. Remember to get the word of the Lord for you life, and to read the scriptures and understand what He is speaking. He has not forgotten you or your dreams because He already destined you from the beginning of time. Remember the vision that He placed in your lap to watch, wait on, and take care of. We are made and created in His image.

Our genetic make up and our DNA is replicated by Jesus life, both through Him and In Him!! "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by Him all things were created things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities, all things were created for Him and by Him. He is before all things and in Him all things hold together" Colossians 1:15-17
