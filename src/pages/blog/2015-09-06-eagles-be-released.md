 As the eagle was released, suddenly I have a vision of pockets of fire being lit up all across the nation. I saw the fire pockets explode and rapidly spread.

In the next scene I am in a room at a table with Billy Graham.  He was sitting with me and a couple other people.  He was writing his will on a piece of paper. Suddenly I fell into travail and I felt the deep pain concerning the immorality in this nation, America. After that Billy Graham stood up and shook my hand.  He spoke to me without words and said "you have my heart".  He looked at me with his blue eyes and I felt the Father God's eyes looking into mine.  I felt like he was giving me something significant and with so much love in his heart.

Now is the time for the eagles to arise and be released to be all they were created to be!! As the eagles are released, fire pockets of His revival healing presence will light up all over the nation.  The bride of the Lord will carry out His voice!  The Father's will is that as you pray and travail over this nation and as you take a stand for righteousness and truth, that He will use you to be a voice for Him, to bring His love and presence to those that do not know Him. Revival fire will break out and an awakening is coming to America that we have never seen before! God is looking for those who have his heart and those who are willing to be released from the top of the mountain.  Now is the time! Esthers Arise!

"Those who "wait" or hope in the Lord will renew their strength, they will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not faint". Isaiah 40:31
