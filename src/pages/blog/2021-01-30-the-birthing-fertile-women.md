# I had a vision/dream of women weepinqg and wailing before me and one of the women’s name was Sharon.  Sharons name means “ fertile one” 







# And I can hear the Lord speaking “bride I sees you in your tears, I sees you in your weeping  and you are the most fertile one of them all! 

# 

#  I hear him say I love your cry and I am going to answer you!  Keep crying out to me!  Weep with tears!  Your pain and loss, your valley was not meant for nothing. 

# 

# For I am going to cause you to be more fruitful than you can imagine!  You will give birth to your promises!” 





# Song of Solomon 2:1

# I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys”
