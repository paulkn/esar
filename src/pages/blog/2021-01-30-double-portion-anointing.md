## I am hearing the Lord speak to me about a double portion anointing  birthed like twins!  He told me that their names are Hannah and Haddasah (also known as Esther) 

## I hear the Lord speaking -

## The Hannah’s and Haddasah twins are being birthed in this hour!

## I am calling  you forth you who have had no children!  You who have lost much!  You have tried to not look at the fact that you are barren in your circumstances  but God himself has called you!    For many many dreams are coming forth.  For I tell you that  in a moment your Samuel will come forth with a voice that cannot be stopped.

## 

## I am calling you forth Esther for you never thought you come to this day.   For the spirit of Jezebel has tried to shut you down  and put you in the closet to silence you.  But you will now be used as a voice to help end abortion and rescue many children.

## I am calling forth the weeping Hannah’s  and the voice of Esther....(Haddasah)

## 

## The double portion anointing of Hannah’s tears for children and Esther’s voice for justice are the double portion twins thay will confront the spirit of Jezebel I this day This is Gods end time strategy to rescue many children and babies not yet born.

## Esther 4:14:“For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”

## ‭‭1 Samuel 1:10-11:“She was deeply distressed and prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly. And she vowed a vow and said, ‘O Lord of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.’”
