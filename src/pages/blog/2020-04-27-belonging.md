![You Belong](/img/dc7a616e-b63b-4812-9481-10afca7c07a9.jpeg)
It’s late at night and I find myself awake at times, with no plans of going to sleep in the foreseeable future. 

Maybe I have felt “forged” by fire. 

That always seemed like such a strange way for something to be made stronger. Blacksmiths heat metal over and over again by hammering it, and somehow that creates a weapon that does not compromise itself in the heat  of the battle.

I have a story to tell. And so does God.  

He is not confused about seasons, about death, about shedding leaves in the winter to make room to breath and grow again.  He created the world but He also made me.  

Have you ever found yourself clinging, hoarding, hiding. 

Hoping to somehow escape the process or tests or trials. 

I want to be the exception in a lot of ways to God’s process over my own heart and mind.  But I can trust his leadership over my life no matter what the circumstances. 

I’ve spent hours, more than I can name crying out for God’s justice over my family, for God’s justice over women and the role they play on the earth. 

In the midst of hardship I have felt the Father lean in and say, trust me. This is a season of belonging and love.

 In the noise and the pain,  God doesn't offer acceleration he offers His heart and love.   How can I belong in a  season of isolation, voicelessness or sorrow? Yet the Lord says, “ I am close to the broken hearted.”

I belong to Jesus , to the one I’ve said yes to time and time again. I belong and rest in Him. 

He isn’t interested in a movement or ministry unless it moves me and others closer to Him.

His love for me and desire for relationship with me is not content to remain on the sidelines.

He never promised a pain free, triumphant life when He desired a relationship with me. 

Jesus is training me and preparing me with a yoke that’s easy and light. He carries the heavy part of the yoke and I get to learn from Him.
