It’s late at night and I find myself awake at times, with no plans of going to sleep in the foreseeable future. 



Maybe I have felt “forged” by fire. 



That always seemed like such a strange way for something to be made stronger. Blacksmiths heat metal over and over again by hammering it, and somehow that creates a weapon that does not compromise itself in the heat  of the battle.



I have a story to tell. And so does God.  

He is not confused about seasons, about death, about shedding leaves in the winter to make room to breath and grow again.  He created the world but He also made me.  



Have you ever found yourself clinging, hoarding, hiding. 

Hoping to somehow escape the process, somehow wanting to arrive at healing at an unprecedented speed.



 I want to be the exception in a lot of ways to God’s process over my own heart and mind. 



I’ve spent hours, more than I can name crying out for God’s justice over my family, for God’s justice over broken relationships, for God’s justice over women and the role they play on the earth. 



In the midst of my heartache I have felt the Father lean in and say, trust me. This is a season of belonging.



 In the noise, and the pain,  God doesn't offer acceleration he offers belonging. How can I belong to this season of isolation? How can I belong to this season of voicelessness? How can I belong to a season of sorrow? Yet the Lord says, “ I am close to the broken hearted.” I belong to Him 



Not as a version of perfectionism,  but I belong to Him.   To the Prince of Peace, to the one I’ve said yes to time and time again. I can belong  and rest in Him. 



He isn’t interested in my movement, unless it moves me closer to Him . 



His love for me and desire for relationship with me is not content to remain on the sidelines.



He never promised a pain free, triumphant life when He desired a relationship with me. He knew the level of pain and anguish that life can carry, so he promised to go with me. So much so that he sent His only Son so that I wouldn't have to bear the weight alone. 



He’s training me and preparing me with a yoke that’s easy and light. He carries the heavy part of the yoke and I get to learn from Him.
